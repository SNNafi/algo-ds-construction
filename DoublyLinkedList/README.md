# Doubly Linked List

## Properties:
__prepend:__ __0(1)__ time & space complexity </br>
__append:__ __0(1)__ time & space complexity </br>
__insert:__ __0(1)__ time & space complexity </br>
__remove:__ __0(1)__ space complexity </br>

## Discussion
The swift version has some extra features. In Swift's, `Node` cannot be created without `prepend()`, `append()` & `insert()`. Swift version also has `count` property to check the size of the linked list.</br>
It is conforms to `Sequence` protocol. As a result, `for..in` can be used with that.

## Info

__Implementation:__ [C++](../DoublyLinkedList/CPP/DoublyLinkedList.cpp), [Swift](../DoublyLinkedList/Swift/DoublyLinkedList.swift) <br>
